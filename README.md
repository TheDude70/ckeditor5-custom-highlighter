CKEditor 5 Custom Highlighter
==============================================

Custom Highlighter to add background color to your text within Ckeditor 5.

## Documentation

The available colors in this plugin are as you can find in the Gmail editor. It also includes an upcast which I require in a personal project where it finds the closest available color. It should be straight forward to modify this for your own needs.

This is a use as is or modify as you require plugin. I will update or modify as I require for personal projects. Requests for options/features you may require for your projects will mostly be ignored. You are free to fork and modify as you see fit.

## Quick start

First, install the build from npm:

```bash
npm install --save ckeditor5-custom-highlighter
```

Use it in your JavaScript application:

```js
import HighlightColor from 'ckeditor5-custom-highlighter/src/highlightcolor';
```
